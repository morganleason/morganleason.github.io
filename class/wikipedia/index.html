            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>There is no exact definition of a megadrought.The term was first used by Connie Woodhouse and
                Jonathan
                Overpeck in their 1998 paper, 2000 Years of Drought Variability in the Central United States. In
                this,
                it referred to two periods of severe drought in the US.Benjamin Cook suggested that the
                definition be a
                drought which is exceptionally severe compared to the weather during the previous 2,000 years.
            </p>
            <h2> Cause</h2>
            <p> Past megadroughts have been associated with persistent multiyear La Niña conditions (cooler than
                normal
                water temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean)</p>
            <h2> Impacts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Megadroughts have historically led to the mass migration of humans away from drought
                    affected
                    lands, resulting in a significant population decline from pre-drought levels.</li>
                <li> They are suspected of playing a primary role in the collapse of several pre-industrial
                    civilizations, including the Anasazi of the North American Southwest,[6] the Khmer Empire of
                    Cambodia,[7] the Mayan of Mesoamerica,[8] the Tiwanaku of Bolivia,[9] and the Yuan Dynasty
                    of China.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Historical Evidence</h2>
            <p>There are several sources for establishing the past occurrence and frequency of megadroughts,
                including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>When megadroughts occur, lakes dry up and trees and other plants grow in the dry lake beds.
                    When the
                    drought ends, the lakes refill; when this happens the trees are submerged and die. In some
                    locations
                    these trees have remained preserved and can be studied giving accurate radio-carbon dates,
                    and the
                    tree rings of the same long dead trees can be studied. Such trees have been found in Mono
                    and Tenaya
                    lakes in California, Lake Bosumtwi in Ghana; and various other lakes. </li>
                <li> Dendrochronology, the dating and study of annual rings in trees. The tree-ring data
                    indicate that
                    the Western U.S. states have experienced droughts that lasted ten times longer than anything
                    the
                    modern U.S. has seen. Based upon data derived from annual tree rings, NOAA has recorded
                    patterns of
                    drought covering most of the U.S. for every year since 1700. Certain species of trees have
                    given
                    evidence over a longer period, in particular Montezuma Cypress and Bristlecone pine trees.
                    The
                    University of Arkansas has produced a 1238-year tree-ring based chronology of weather
                    condition in
                    central Mexico by examining core samples taken from living Montezuma Cypress trees.</li>
                <li> Sediment core samples taken at the volcanic caldera in Valles Caldera, New Mexico and other
                    locations. The cores from Valles Caldera go back 550,000 years and show evidence of
                    megadroughts
                    that lasted as long as 1,000 years during the mid-Pleistocene Epoch during which summer
                    rains were
                    almost non-existent. Plant and pollen remains found in core samples from the bottom of lakes
                    have
                    been also studied and added to the record.</li>
                <li> Fossil corals on Palmyra Atoll. Using the relationship between tropical Pacific sea surface
                    temperatures and the oxygen isotope ratio in living corals to convert fossil coral records
                    into sea
                    surface temperatures. This has been used to establish the occurrence and frequency of La
                    Niña
                    conditions.</li>
